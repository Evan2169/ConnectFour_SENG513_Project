RUNNING THE SERVER
Navigate to the top-level directory of the project.
$cd $PATH/ConnectFour
Install dependencies needed for running typescript (I believe only ts-node is necessary).
$npm install ts-node tslint typescript nodemon
Run the following command to start the server
$ npm start

VIEWING IN THE BROWSER
My project is hardcoded to run on localhost:8080. To change this, adjustments would need to be made in "src/back_end/start.ts", "src/front_end/game/game.js", and "src/front_end/index/index.js".

NOTE
- All other dependencies should be installed automatically. I tried to get ts-node to not need extra installation steps, but couldn't get it working.
- Opening my project in multiple windows/tabs of the same browser will break it. If it is run in different browsers or on different machines, it will work dandy. It does not seem to work on my phone (Samsung Galaxy S6 in Chrome), with the problem seeming to come from Websockets not working properly.
- Code got a little sloppy with the last bit of functionality that I was working on. "ConnectFourGame.ts" and "GameMapper.ts" are unnecessarily coupled and a little tough to read.
- I was able to run my server on the CPSC Linux machines following the steps I've provided.
